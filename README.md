The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) collects information on the locations, dates, perpetrators, and fatalities that have occurred in armed conflicts around the globe. ACLED released a dataset in 2017 that contained conflict data for the continent of Africa. The data contained in this dataset was analysed with microsoft excel and used to create 3 visualizations that explore part of the history of armed conflict on the continent. Additional information on these graphics is available in the written report located inside this repo.<br>

This project was prepared and presented as a mid-term requirement for Regis Univesity's Masters of Data Science Data Visualization class. <br>

The base dataset is too large for github to host. It has been seperated from the analysis file. Get a copy of the raw data here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DNNJ23i4rfjvnnZhjANkCpeXBgAYPvd1
